# This is a sample build configuration for PHP.
# Check our guides at https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/e8YWN for more examples.
# Only use spaces to indent your .yml configuration.
# -----

# Specify a docker image from Docker Hub as your build environment.
# All of your pipeline scripts will be executed within this docker image.

image: php:5.6.30

# You might want to create and access a service (like a database) as part
# of your Pipeline workflow. You can do so by defining it as a service here.

definitions:
    services:

        # Your service can be named anything - what runs is determined
        # by the Docker Hub image you specify.

        mongo:
            image: mongo

# All of your Pipelines will be defined in the `pipelines` section.
# You can have any number of Pipelines, but they must all have unique
# names. The default Pipeline is simply named `default`.

pipelines:
    default:

        # Each Pipeline consists of one or more steps which each execute
        # sequentially in separate docker containers.
        #
        # name: optional name for this step
        # script: the commands you wish to execute in this step, in order

        - step:
            name: Building Application
            script:
                - echo "Building Application"

        # Your Pipeline automatically contains a copy of your code in its working
        # directory; however, the docker image may not be preconfigured with all
        # of the PHP extensions your project requires. You may need to install
        # them yourself, as shown below.
        #
        # REMEMBER: each Step executes in a separate container, so scripts you
        # execute here will have no effect on the containers executing future
        # Steps. You might need to copy files manually between Steps, or you
        # might prefer to run everything in one Step.
        #
        # caches: idk lol
        # artifacts: files which should be copied into the next Pipeline Step
